Harshil's current projects

"ATMServices” + “Accounts” - This project is a Virtual ATM machine using Java that allows users to create their own checking and saving accounts and perform different types of transactions (deposit, withdraw, and transferring between the two accounts). 

"InternationalLove” + “CurencyConversionFP" - This project is a simple online clothing store I had created with three major functions. First, the user is promoted to pick their products along with the number of each product. Then they are asked if they are eligible for a military or senior discount. Lastly, If the consumer is from another country, they are asked if they would like to convert their currency to USD. 

"EncryptPassword" - This project is a password encryption model. The user is asked to enter their password normally and also asked how many characters they would like to shift their password. The program then encrypts their password. 

"Employee Attrition R-Code Data Analysis + Employee Data" - This project is a deep analysis of a company's employees and why they choose to leave the company. The project compares many different factors to determine whether they have any correlation to employees leaving the organization using r.
